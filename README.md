# Python_Collection

> hello, world

## Projects

I primarily code in **python** for my various subjects, that means **chemistry**, **physics**, **math** and **IT** all have their own file where I have made "some" code for each of them.

### IT 2

The IT 2 file is where the majority of all my code is stored. I started coding more dedicatedly around 2023; before then, it was small stuff I would code and then forget.
